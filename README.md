Improving the Manageability of Health Receptionists and Patients

# The Problem & Solution

Health facilities’ software pertaining to the management of patients and digital resources is inefficient and bombarding. Limited receptionists in health facilities are struggling to take care of patients’ appointments and records. Quicksilver Clinic Software will mitigate this problem to ease the process for both health receptionists and adult patients at our Mississauga locations through a separate interface for patients. Patients have access to easy-to-sign-up appointments, regularly updated healthcare data and informative health information; for healthcare receptionists to access patient data.

# How it Works

The software will have a sign-up and login page where one can enter personal information on the sign-up page to be uploaded as their profile. The other option for the login page is for patients, which directs you to a page with tabs that help patients to schedule their appointments updated by SQL data, contact emergency services, and provide descriptions of common diseases; all while the user has a personalized account.
